#2. Write a Python program that allows users to log their hiking trips. The program
should:
- Use a while loop to repeatedly ask for a hike name and distance in miles
- Save each entry to hiking_log.txt (each hike on a new line)
- When the user presses 0, exit the loop & print the contents of hiking_log.txt
