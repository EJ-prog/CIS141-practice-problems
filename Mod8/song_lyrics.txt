Take a picture and I
See a million shades of light
And it swallows me whole
From my head down to my toes

Like a masterpiece unveiled
Every time we touch
I was sleeping at the wheel
Till you woke me up

With all your colors
Come on and paint my life with all your colors
I wanna fill my eyes
Life's a kaleidoscope, you let the light in
I want to spend the night in all your colors
You make me come alive

Colors
You make me come alive
Colors
You make me come alive in colors

Like a ribbon of light
I can follow through the night
And it swallows me whole from my head down to my toes

Like a masterpiece unveiled
Every time we touch
I was sleeping at the wheel
Till you woke me up

With all your colors
Come on and paint my life with all your colors
I wanna fill my eyes
Life's a kaleidoscope, you let the light in
I wanna spend the night in all your colors
You make me come alive in color

Colors
You make me come alive
Colors
You make me come alive
Colors
You make me come alive in color
